        <p>The Social Contract is the implied agreement between members of a community to abide by the rules. These rules are put into
            place in order to achieve a greater well being of society. An earlier version of the Social Contract created systems and 
            outlined the government. However, an updated version ceasing those limits was needed in order for it to gain popularity
            and functionality. The general will of the people is described as the will of all, and then substracting the parts where 
            individual wills clash. One aspect of government that uses the social contract is paying taxes. In the US today, people pay
            taxes in which then benefit them: highways, post offices, and public education.  <br>

Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Discourse on The Social Contract

“Man was/is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.”
moving from a misleading contract to a real one, the misleading one was too systematic and outlines a government
soverignty is not just having the power, but using it for good
abstact idea, not specific
general will is infallible
individual will vs general will
