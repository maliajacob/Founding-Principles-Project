        <p>The natural man is free, with no one else to govern him-that is his own property. Jurisdiction and power were
            given the same to all men, and remains that way unless one sets himself above another and is granted
            sovereignty.
            We have not the liberty to destory ourselves or any creature, because man belongs to one omnipotent being
            and work to his pleasure.
            The same God who gave us the earth also gave us reasons to use it, to make the best of our lives. Earth's
            resources are for the people, henceforth, no one has a domain 'exclusive to the rest of mankind'.
            One's labors belong to them, and when they work, it becomes their property too.
            And the earth must be used as benefit for all people-for comfort, peace, security, and convinience. Of the
            beginning of a political society, people unite to those same advantages, and no one is excluded.
            The majority should choose what this community does, and some freedoms must be given to ensure the general
            welfare.
            Representatives are the "fences" of our property. The legistalive has power which everyone tries to secure,
            and if abused, the power must be forfeited to the people.
            And the supreme executor has double trust, and can act contrary to that trust in various ways.
            A government always changing to the will of the poeple is unstable, as well as a government that never
            changes.
            When people are mistreated, they will stand for what they want. <br>

<!-- 
Locke notes: 
- on the state of nature
natural state of man has free will
natural man is equal (power and jurisdiction) in nature, unless you set yourself above another and are granted sovereignty
we have not the liberty to destory ourselves or any creature. we belong to one omnipotent being and work to his pleasure
- of property
the same God who gave us the earth also gave us reasons to use it, to make the best of our lives
no one has a domain "exclusive" to every one else
we must use the earth to the benefit of all peopleâ€“comfort, advantage, and convenience
our labors belong to us, and when we work, it becomes our property
- of the beginning of political societies
no one is subject to political power without their consent
people choose to unite with others for greater comfort, peace, and security than those who do not. no one is excluded.
the majority should choose what this community does
social contract, give up some of your natural freedoms for the well being of the comminity, because if you don't the purpose of the society would mean nothing
- of the dissolution of government
people join the government for the preservation of their property
legislative, supreme executor
representatives are the "fences" of our property
voting without discussion gives away your power as a voter
people may be hesitant or reject creating a new constitution
hypothesis, people are unstable, people want things to stay the same... stay in their "old forms"
when people are mistreated, people will stand for what they want
word bank:
nature
free
equal
independent
power
enjoyment
advantage
equality of man, the natural
                    rights and responsibilites, the benefits of government, the three branches of government, and causes of a
                    failed of a government
