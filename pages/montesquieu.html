            type of government. Everyone needs the opportunity to thrive in order to not 
            have self-seekers. "Demoracies can become corrupt in two ways: <i>the spirit of inequality</i> and <i>the spirit of extreme equality</i>"
            The core principles of a good government are described as <i>human passions set in motion</i>. These laws too can become corrupt. 
            <i>Constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it ... it is
                necessary from the very nature of things that power should be a check to power</i>. This is done throughout the separation of powers. Having three branches of government with checks and balances creates a harmonious system.

<!-- 
Baron de Montesquieuâ€™s Spirit of the Laws
there are three types of government: republican, monarchies, despotism
    fixed and established laws, core principles (aka "human passions set in motion"... they can be corrupted)
    choose for themselves, people who govern
    democracy is political virtue "the love of the laws and of our country"
    sufferage and voting are fundamental
    to keep a functioning democracy requires constant care
    government "limits ambition to the sole desire, to the sole happiness, of doing greater services to our country"
    "ordinary passions are fed"
    everyone needs to opportunity to thrive in order to not have self-seekers who may commit crimes
    equal distribution of property
    demoracies can become corrupt in two ways: "the spirit of inequality" and "the spirit of extreme equality"

aristocracy. moderation. 
    1. laws must prevent abuse to the people, deny the nobility power like tax. 
    2. disguise the difference between the nobility and the people, so the people don't feel they lack power
    3. equality with the nobles

monarchy
    independent judiciary and nobility
    laws designed to preserve their power... not based on virtue like republican, laws made to keep them separate from despotism
    corruptions of a monarchy

despotism: diminish ambition and create fear, continual corruption

republican and monarchial need specific motivatoin
political liberty is "a tranquillity
of mind arising from the opinion each person has of his safety"

"all punishment which is not derived from necessity is
tyrannical. The law is not a mere act of power; things in their own nature indifferent are not within its
province"
laws should make it as easy as possible for an innocent person to prove his or
her innocence... performed outwardly
