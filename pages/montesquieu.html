        <p>Life in the quaint little village of Willowbrook was as serene as the gentle rustle of leaves in a summer
            breeze. Nestled amidst rolling hills and lush greenery, it was a place where time seemed to slow down,
            allowing its inhabitants to savor each moment. The cobblestone streets, lined with charming cottages and
            blooming gardens, were always abuzz with the laughter of children and the chatter of neighbors. In the heart
            of the village stood an ancient oak tree, its gnarled branches stretching wide, providing shade and solace
            to those seeking refuge from the day's hustle. Every Sunday, the villagers gathered in the central square
            for a lively market, where the aroma of freshly baked bread and the vibrant colors of handmade crafts filled
            the air. Willowbrook was a haven of tranquility, where simplicity reigned, and the beauty of everyday life
            was cherished by all who called it home. <br>

<!-- 
Baron de Montesquieuâ€™s Spirit of the Laws
there are three types of government: republican, monarchies, despotism
    fixed and established laws, core principles (aka "human passions set in motion"... they can be corrupted)
    choose for themselves, people who govern
    democracy is political virtue "the love of the laws and of our country"
    sufferage and voting are fundamental
    to keep a functioning democracy requires constant care
    government "limits ambition to the sole desire, to the sole happiness, of doing greater services to our country"
    "ordinary passions are fed"
    everyone needs to opportunity to thrive in order to not have self-seekers who may commit crimes
    equal distribution of property
    demoracies can become corrupt in two ways: "the spirit of inequality" and "the spirit of extreme equality"

aristocracy. moderation. 
    1. laws must prevent abuse to the people, deny the nobility power like tax. 
    2. disguise the difference between the nobility and the people, so the people don't feel they lack power
    3. equality with the nobles

monarchy
    independent judiciary and nobility
    laws designed to preserve their power... not based on virtue like republican, laws made to keep them separate from despotism
    corruptions of a monarchy

despotism: diminish ambition and create fear, continual corruption

republican and monarchial need specific motivatoin
political liberty is "a tranquillity
of mind arising from the opinion each person has of his safety"
"constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it ... it is
necessary from the very nature of things that power should be a check to power" separation of power
"all punishment which is not derived from necessity is
tyrannical. The law is not a mere act of power; things in their own nature indifferent are not within its
province"
laws should make it as easy as possible for an innocent person to prove his or
her innocence... performed outwardly
